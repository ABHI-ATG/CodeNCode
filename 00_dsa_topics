Linked List
Concepts:
* Inititial Node Creation
* Fast And Slow pointer 
* Reverse Linked List (k nodes reversal)
Problems:
* Middle Node (Slow and Fast Pointer)
* Delete Nth Node from End 
* Reverse Singly Linked List (Recursively)
* Pallindrome in Liked List (slow and fast pointer to get middle node then reverse the right linked list of the middle node then check for Pallindrome);
* Reorder List (same concept of above)
* Reverse Node in K-Group (Initial Node Creation and reverse k nodes)
* Cycle
  - find pos of first node of cycle
  - find number of nodes in cycle
  - remove loop

* Merge Sorted List
    - k list
* Insertion Sort
* Segregate Even and Odd numbers
* Addition and Subtraction

Search in Sorted Rotated Array



A greedy algorithm :
is a simple and efficient algorithmic approach for solving any given problem by selecting the best available option at that moment of time, without bothering about the future results. In simple words, here, it is believed that the locally best choices made would be leading to globally best results.
