/*

    Two Points x1,y1 and x2,y2;

    Cross Product is x1*y2-x2*y1

    slope of first point = y1/x1
    slope of second point = y2/x2

    lets say, slope of first point>slope of second point
                y1/x1 > y2/x2
                x1*y2-x2*y < 0

    if x1*y2-x2*y1 < 0, this means point1 is in left of point2

    Note, we can find the area of triangle formed by point1 and point2 and (0,0):
    1/2 * cross product
